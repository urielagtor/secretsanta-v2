A privacy-focused Secret Santa app with client-side encryption. No accounts, no emails stored, no backend database.

Check it live on [mael.dev/secretsanta/](https://mael.dev/secretsanta/) 🎄

Should you appreciate this tool so much that you'd like to thank me, you can either drop a friendly note in this repository's issues, or be a [one-time sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/arcanis?frequency=one-time&sponsor=arcanis). Either would make my day 😊

## How to Use

1. **Add participants** - Enter names in the Participants section
2. **Set rules (optional)** - Click the rules icon to add MUST or MUST NOT constraints (e.g., spouses can't draw each other)
3. **Add instructions (optional)** - Set budget, exchange date, or location in Settings
4. **Generate pairings** - Click Generate to create randomised assignments
5. **Share links** - Send each participant their unique encrypted link via email, text, etc.

Each link only reveals one assignment - the recipient sees who they're buying a gift for, nothing else.
